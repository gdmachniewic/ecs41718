                  When I was six, my parents signed me up for soccer, and the coach put me in as goalkeeper in one game, and ever since, I love playing goalkeeper. Then later on, when I was 9, I couldn't play soccer in the winter since it was snowing. One day, I went to a basketball gym with my older cousin and she introduced basketball to me, and recommended me to play as a center, and ever since I still play basketball, mostly in the winter. I was introduced to video games when I was 10, when my father bought me an Xbox 360 to surprise me, and all I ever played on te Xbox was Fifa, since Fifa 12 and all the way till now, Fifa 18. I started singing when I was 11, when I joined my Polish Church's Choir, and I loved it for some reason, and I stil sing now ever since. Last summer, in 2016, I started to watch a person who created beats, by the name of Justin Sharpe, and I was really intrigued by it, so I installed the same application he used to create beats, and started to make my own beats ever since.
