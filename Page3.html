        From kindergarden to sixth grade, I went to John Barry Elementary School, and then I got accepted to a charter school, called Intrinsic Schools. I attended Intrinsic for 7th and 8th grade. I then decided to leave Intrinsic since I didn't like the way they teached. I then applyed for Lane Tech for high school, in which I was accepted and now I'm here. All the grades I ever gotten during my educational life were A's and B's, and every year I've gotten honor roll.

        Some accomplishments I've had was won a singing competition with my group, getting accepted to Intrinsic Schools, and to Lane Tech. I led my elementary's soccer team to their first ever playoffs. I've gotten honor rolls from every grade.
